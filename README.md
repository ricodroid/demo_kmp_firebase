# KMM with Shared Datastore Preferences, Koin, Ktor, MOKO Shared Resources, MOKO KSwift, and MOKO MVVM

This KMM Kotlin Multiplatform project uses shared datastore preferences, Koin, Ktor, and MOKO
libraries to show an Onboarding screen and fetch product data from an API for both Android and iOS.

## Part 2: KMM MOKO Shared Color Resources, Firebase In-App Messaging and Analytics, Deep Links for Android and iOS

In my next video, I use MOKO Resources shared colors to create a light and dark theme for my Android Jetpack
Compose and iOS apps. I also set up Firebase In-App Messaging and Analytics for both Android and iOS.
When the Onboarding is complete, an Analytics event is sent to Firebase, which triggers the In-App
Message campaign. The message has a button that deep links to the sign in screen, and works for
Android and iOS.
