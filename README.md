# KMM with Shared Datastore Preferences, Koin, Ktor, MOKO Shared Resources, MOKO KSwift, and MOKO MVVM

This KMM Kotlin Multiplatform project uses shared datastore preferences, Koin, Ktor, and MOKO
libraries to show an Onboarding screen and fetch product data from an API for both Android and iOS.

## Part 2: KMM MOKO Shared Color Resources, Firebase In-App Messaging and Analytics, Deep Links for Android and iOS

In my next video, I use MOKO Resources shared colors to create a light and dark theme for my Android
Jetpack Compose and iOS apps. I also set up Firebase In-App Messaging and Analytics for both Android
and iOS. When the Onboarding is complete, an Analytics event is sent to Firebase, which triggers the
In-App Message campaign. The message has a button that deep links to the sign in screen, and works
for Android and iOS.

## Part 4: Firebase AuthUI with Jetpack Compose and Firestore with KMM Shared Module

Here I add Firebase AuthUI to my Android app, and customize the UI with a resource file and custom
logo. I also use Firebase Kotlin SDK to add Firestore to my KMM shared module.
